## PDF Chat Application
    Interact with your PDF files in a conversational way! This Streamlit-based        application allows you to upload PDFs, process their content, and ask       
    questions about the text extracted from the documents. Using advanced AI 
    models   from Google Generative AI, this tool provides detailed, accurate, 
    and context-aware responses.

# Features
1. **PDF Upload and Processing:**
    Upload multiple PDF files.
    Extract text from PDFs efficiently using PyPDF2.
   
2. **Text Chunking:**
    Split large text into manageable chunks for better context handling.
   
3. **AI-Powered Q&A:**
    Leverage Google Generative AI (gemini-pro) for question-answering.
    Responses are generated based on the uploaded PDF content.
   
4. **Vector Embedding and Search:**
    Use FAISS to create and store vector embeddings for similarity-based context      retrieval.
   
5. **Streamlit Interface:**
    User-friendly interface for PDF upload, processing, and querying.

# How It Works
1. **Upload PDFs:**
    Drag and drop one or more PDF files into the app.
   
2. **Text Extraction:**
    Text is extracted from the uploaded PDFs using PyPDF2.
   
3. **Text Chunking:**
    The extracted text is split into smaller chunks using LangChain's           
    RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to ensure efficient context handling.
   
4. **Vector Store Creation:**
    Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings using Google Generative AI.
    These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for similarity search.
   
5. **Question-Answering:**
    Users type a question based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.
    Relevant chunks are retrieved using similarity search and passed to Google's 
    Generative AI model to generate a detailed response.
   
6. **Response Display:**
    The app displays the AI's response in a clear and concise manner.
